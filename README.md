Image Sprite-Sheet Creation
===========================

Simple tool to generate a sprite sheet from a directory of png files. 

Status
------

Working prototype, with hard-coded paths and dimensions. It meets my immediate need, but clearly there's more we could do here. 

Dependencies
------------

npm install gd // install into local node_modules directory

promise-io // npm has a copy, I got mine from https://github.com/kriszyp/promised-io not sure if they are identical

you'll also need GD itself obviously. I followed the instructions in the gd module's README.
